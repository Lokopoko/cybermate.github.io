            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"> Any hacker must take some common steps to become an ethical hacker, the bare minimum of which is to make sure you have documented permission from the right people before breaking into something. Not breaking the law is paramount to being an
                ethical hacker. All professional penetration testers should follow a code of ethics to guide everything they do. The EC-Council, creators of the Certificated Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam, have one of the best public code of ethics available.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Most ethical hackers become professional penetration testers one of two ways. Either they learn hacking skills on their own or they take formal education classes. Many, like me, did both. Although sometimes mocked by self-learners, ethical
                hacking courses and certifications are often the gateway to a good paying job as a full-time penetration tester. </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Today’s IT security education curriculum is full of courses and certifications that teach someone how to be an ethical hacker. For most of the certification exams you can self-study and bring your own experience to the testing center or take
                an approved education course. While you don’t need an ethical hacking certification to get employed as professional penetration tester, it can’t hurt.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">As CBT Nuggets trainer, Keith Barker said, “I think the opportunity to have 'certified ethical anything' on your resume can only be a good thing, but it’s more of an entry way into more study. Plus, if companies see that you are certified
                in ethical hacking, they know you have seen and agreed to a particular code of ethics. If an employer is looking at resumes and they see someone who has an ethical hacking certification and someone that didn't, it’s got to help.” call
                them crackers instead of hackers.</p>
