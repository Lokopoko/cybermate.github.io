            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or pen testing, is legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. It's among the most exciting IT jobs any person can be involved in. You are literally getting
                paid to keep up with the latest technology and get to break into computers without the threat of being arrested. Companies engage ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities in their systems. From the penetration tester's point of view,
                there is no downside: If you hack in past the current defenses, you’ve given the client a chance to close the hole before an attacker discovers it. If you don’t find anything, your client is even happier because they now get to declare
                their systems “secure enough that even paid hackers couldn’t break into it.” Win-win! [ Find out how to do penetration testing

            <p class="sectionTag text-big-pages">What do ethical hackers do?
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Discovery: Learn about your target</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Every ethical hacker begins their asset hacking (excluding social engineering techniques for this discussion) by learning as much about the pen test targets as they can. They want to know IP addresses, OS platforms, applications, version numbers,
                patch levels, advertised network ports, users, and anything else that can lead to an exploit. It is a rarity that an ethical hacker won’t see an obvious potential vulnerability by spending just a few minutes looking at an asset. At the
                very least, even if they don’t see something obvious, they can use the information learned in discovery for continued analysis and attack tries.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Exploitation: Break into the target asset</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This is what the ethical hacker is being paid for – the “break-in.” Using the information learned in the discovery phase, the pen tester needs to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access (or denial of service, if that is the goal).
                If the hacker can’t break-in to a particular asset, then they must try other in-scope assets. Personally, if I’ve done a thorough discovery job, then I’ve always found an exploit. I don’t even know of a professional penetration tester
                that has not broken into an asset they were hired to break into, at least initially, before their delivered report allowed the defender to close all the found holes. I’m sure there are penetration testers that don’t always find exploits
                and accomplish their hacking goals, but if you do the discovery process thoroughly enough, the exploitation part isn’t as difficult as many people believe. Being a good penetration tester or hacker is less about being a genius and more
                about patience and thoroughness. Depending on the vulnerability and exploit, the now gained access may require “privilege escalation” to turn a normal user’s access into higher administrative access. This can require a second exploit to
                be used, but only if the initial exploit didn’t already give the attacker privileged access. Depending on what is in scope, the vulnerability discovery can be automated using exploitation or vulnerability scanning software. The latter
                software type usually finds vulnerabilities,but does not exploit them to gain unauthorized access. Next, the pen tester either performs the agreed upon goal action if they are in their ultimate destination, or they use the currently exploited
                computer to gain access closer to their eventual destination. Pen testers and defenders call this “horizontal” or “vertical” movement, depending on whether the attacker moves within the same class of system or outward to non-related systems.
                Sometimes the goal of the ethical hacker must be proven as attained (such as revealing system secrets or confidential data) or the mere documentation of how it could have been successfully accomplished is enough.
