            <p class="sectionTag text-big-pages">10 gadgets every hacker needs in their toolkit

            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">Sometimes, during security audits, we may encounter a situation where everything is being managed correctly. In other words security patches, policies, network segmentation, antivirus, and user awareness, to name just a few measures, are being
                applied properly. That’s when, in order to continue the analysis from the perspective of a security researcher or consultant, social engineering and a number of other tools, some of which we will look at in this post, start to play more
                importance, being perhaps the only ones that can allow an attacker to penetrate the target system.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">The tools in question are mainly pieces of hardware designed for security research or projects. So here’s a list of the 10 tools every white hat hacker needs.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#1 Raspberry Pi 3
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1.jpg" alt="">
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">We are now on the third generation of these low-budget computers, which can be used in multiple ways. A classic example in security audits is to use a Raspberry Pi with its appropriate battery pack, a distribution platform like Kali Linux,
                and applications like FruityWifi, which together act like the Swiss army knife of pen testing.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#2 WiFi Pineapple*</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2.png" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This set of tools for wireless penetration tests is very useful for various types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attack. Through an intuitive web interface, it enables you to connect using any device, such as a smartphone or a tablet.
                It stands out for its ease of use, workflow management, the detailed information it provides, and the possibility it offers to emulate different kinds of advanced attacks, which are always just a couple of clicks away.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">As a platform, WiFi Pineapple allows the use of a great many modules, which are continually being developed by the user community, thus adding new features that widen its scope of functionality. The icing on the cake is that these modules
                can be installed free of charge directly via the web interface in a matter of seconds.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#3 Alfa Network Board*</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">A classic Wi-Fi board for injecting packets. The Alfa stands out for the quality of its materials, and for its use of chipsets which can be set to monitoring mode – a requirement for wireless audits.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#4 Rubber Ducky*</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/3.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This “special” pen drive is a device that works as a programmed keyboard in the shape of a USB drive. When you plug it into a computer, it starts writing automatically to launch programs and tools which may either be available on the victim
                computer or loaded onto the drive’s onboard Micro SD, in order to extract information.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">If you watch the hit TV series Mr. Robot, you’ll likely remember that in the second season Rubber Ducky is a crucial ally for Angela, helping her gain access to an E Corp executive’s passwords.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#5 LAN Turtle</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/4.png" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This type of systems admin and pen-test tool provides stealthy remote access, as it stays connected to a USB port covertly. Besides this, it allows users to harvest information from the network and has the capacity to execute a man-in-the-middle
                attack.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#6 HackRF One</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/5.png" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This tool installs a powerful SDR (Software-Defined Radio) system. In other words it is essentially a radio communication device which installs software to be used in place of typically installed hardware. This way, it is capable of processing
                all kinds of radio signals ranging from 10 MHz to 6 GHz from a single peripheral, which can be connected to the computer via a USB port.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#7 Ubertooth One</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/6.png" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">This device is an open-source 2.4 GHz code development platform for experimenting with Bluetooth, enabling users to appreciate the different aspects of new wireless technologies.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#8 Proxmark3 Kit</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/7.png" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">The Proxmark3 is a device developed by Jonathan Westhues that can read almost any RFID (radio frequency identification) label, as well as clone and sniff them. It can also be operated in standalone mode (i.e. without a PC) through the use
                of batteries.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#9 Lockpicks</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">It is important to be aware that in some countries, possession of lockpicks is a criminal act. We do not recommend any activity that could be against the law. Please verify the regulations in your country before acquiring any of these tools
                – the same applies for the other gadgets listed in this article.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages"><img src="https://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lockpicking.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">These tools are the main equipment used in lockpicking – in other words the art of opening a lock or a physical security device by analyzing or manipulating its components logically, without the original key. There are a great many sizes and
                formats or kits, which in many cases can threaten physical security.</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-big-pages">#10 Keylogger</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small-pages">An old classic for logging keystrokes. This device can be connected via USB or PS/2 and creates a stealthy connection between the keyboard and PC, logging every keystroke. Of course, it tends to go undetected by most security systems.</p>
